    "# Takeoff Pygame Project\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will be creating a game from scratch using the Pygame modules. This game will take the form of an endless runner or dodge game. In these types of games, a player continues on a single infinite level dodging obstacles until they hit one and end the game. Oftentimes, the player is moving to the right (background and obstacles move to the left) while avoiding obstacles. Rather in this game, our player will be moving up while dodging obstacles that are falling down. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Mechanics\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Controls:\n",
    "The player will have 3 separate controls. The first control will be the spacebar which will move the character upward. The character will automatically want to fall downward, therefore holding the spacebar will allow you to move up and releasing the spacebar will make the character natually fall. The second and third controls will be the left and right arrow keys to move the character to the left and right respectively. Through these 3 controls, the player can move their character in all directions in the 2D plane of the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Boundaries:\n",
    "Boundary conditions will be set at the edges of the game window. The left and right boundaries along with the top boundary will serve as borders that the game will not allow you to pass. Therefore, your character will stop at any of these sides if the player attempts to move their character past them. The bottom boundary on the other hand will serve as a possible way of ending the game. If the player allows their character to fall too far to the point that they fall to the bottom boundary, the character will explode and the game will be over.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Obstacles:\n",
    "Obstacles will continuously fall from the top of the screen towards the bottom. Their positions will be randomly generated and therefore unpredictable. This is done so that the player has to act on reaction to seeing the obstacle rather than knowledge of knowing where it will be. As the player advances through the game, the obstacles will become faster. This will make the game progressively more difficult as time advances. When the player allows the character to collide with an obstacle, the character will explode and the game will end.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Score\n",
    "The objective of the game is to obtain the highest possible score. The player is awarded a single point for every obstacle that is sucessfully dodged as it exists the bottom of the screen. This means that as the game progresses, points can be accumulated faster due to higher numbers of obstacles and their faster speeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theme, Visuals, and Audio\n",
    "This game will have a space theme. The name takeoff comes from the character being a rocketship as it takes off and flies when the spacebar is held. The obstacles will be asteroids that fall from the top. A flame will come from the bottom of the rocket while the spacebar is held and a corresponding rocket booster noise will accompany. There will be a fun scifi space backround with fast paced game music in the background. When the player dies, the rocket will turn into an explotion and their will be an explosive noise to go along with this as well. The current score will appear at the top left of the screen throughout the game."
